**Terrae: premium grade Natural Sodium Bentonite**

Bentonite is a mineral, and usually forms, over millions of years, from weathering of volcanic ash, most often in the presence of water. It's easily found in many countries of the world. 

It can be found both as Calcium and Sodium forms. Only Natural Sodium Bentonite, containing mostly **extremely hidroactive nanosized clusters of Montmorillonite**, has the unique property to swell once hydrated: it can absorb several times its dry weight in water, forming, at ultra low concentrations, a gel suspension. Thanks to his exclusive molecular affinity with water, Terrae can support nearly unlimited cycles of hydration and dehydration
